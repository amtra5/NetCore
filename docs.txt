NetServer:
Usage-
server.StartListener(ByVal port As Int32) - Starts the server
server.StopListener() - Stops the server
server.tblClients - Hash table of clients by GUID

Sending Messages-
'client is an instance of NetClientObj that is generated by NetServer
client.ID - The client GUID
client.Send(ByVal data As String) - Sends data to the client

Events-
evtClientConnected(ByVal client As NetClientObj) - New client has connected
evtClientDisconnected(ByVal client As NetClientObj) - Client has disconnected
evtReceived(ByVal client As NetClientObj, ByVal data As String) - Client has sent a message

Example-
Dim server = New NetServer() 'Create a new server object

'Assign callbacks to events
Private Sub OnConnected(ByVal client As NetClient)
    client.send("Hello " & client.ID & "!") 'Send the client a welcome message
    ...
End Sub

Private Sub OnDisConnected(ByVal client As NetClient)
    ...
End Sub

Private Sub OnLineReceived(ByVal client As NetClient, ByVal data As String)
    ...
End Sub

AddHandler server.evtClientConnected, AddressOf OnConnected 
AddHandler server.evtClientDisconnected, AddressOf OnDisconnected
AddHandler server.evtRecieved, AddressOf OnLineReceived

...

server.StopListener()

---------------

NetClient:

Usage-
client = New NetClient(ByVal ip As String, ByVal port As Int32) - Connects to a server
client.StopConnection() - Closes the connection with the server
client.SendMessage(ByVal data As String) - Sends data to the server

Events-
evtDisconnected() - Triggered when the connection to the server is disconnected
evtReceived(ByVal data As String) - Triggered data is received from the server

Example-
Dim client = New NetClient("127.0.0.1", "8080") 'Connects to the server at 127.0.0.1:8080

'Assign callbacks to events
Private Sub OnDisConnected()
    ...
End Sub

Private Sub OnLineReceived(ByVal data As String)
    ...
End Sub

AddHandler server.evtDisconnected, AddressOf OnDisconnected
AddHandler server.evtRecieved, AddressOf OnLineReceived

client.SendMessage("Hello Server!") 'Sends a message to the server

client.StopConnection() 'Closes the connection with the server
